== Minimal app to show Synchronizer Model conflict with New Relic RPM 2.9.9

= Get the app working as expected

To test the app, simply clone this rep then ./script/server

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` , the app should show a list of 3 synchronizers :

    * Synchronizer 1
    * Synchronizer 2
    * Synchronizer 3


= Activate New Relic RPM 2.9.9

Just uncomment the gem loading within config/environment.rb (right now the gem is unpacked)

Relaunch the server and KaBoom !

    NoMethodError in SynchronizersController#index
    undefined method `all' for Sync:Class
    ...


Let me know if you need any help to investigate this issue.
